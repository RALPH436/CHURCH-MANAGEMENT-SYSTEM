# Church Management System

This repository contains a Church Management System designed to assist churches in organizing and managing their daily operations.

The system provides tools for managing church members, tracking attendance, recording events, monitoring financial offerings, and handling expenses.

It is primarily intended for use as a standalone or locally hosted system; however, it may also be implemented in an online environment if required.

The system includes user account management with role-based access to ensure secure and controlled usage.

Administrators can manage user accounts, oversee records, and maintain system data integrity.

Member management features allow the recording and updating of personal information, contact details, and membership status.

Attendance tracking enables accurate monitoring of member participation across various church activities and services.

Event management supports the scheduling of church activities with relevant details such as date, time, location, and descriptions.

Financial management features allow the recording of church offerings and expenses to support transparency and accountability.

The system is designed to maintain organized records, improve operational efficiency, and support reliable reporting.

This project serves as a practical solution for churches seeking a structured and efficient management system.
